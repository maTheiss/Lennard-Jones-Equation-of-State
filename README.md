# Lennard-Jones-Equation-of-State

This is a Python implementation of the Lennard-Jones Equation of State of Thol et al. 

Note: 
  - routines are also implemented in order to calculate the vapor-liquid equilibrium 
  - reference data from NIST and Stoll et al. are included 

Written by: M. Theiss 

To-Do's:
  - VLE prevention steps
  - comput. of the critical point 

The implementation aligns with the following literature.
